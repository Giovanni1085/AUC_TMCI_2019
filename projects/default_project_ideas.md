## Media and politics

### Social media politics

How election campaigns unfold on social media? Pick one or more campaign and track how different candidates engage with certain topics during the campaign. Possible datasets: news, Twitter.

### How are Bible (or Quran etc.) quotes used on Twitter?

A simple but important question, given the role of religion in society. Inspiration: [America's Public Bible](http://americaspublicbible.org/). Possible datasets: news, Twitter.

### Media polarity

Media are often supporting an agenda on their own. Can this agenda be discovered by analysing how differently they report the same news? Build a polarity profile for different media, considering a choice of the variety of datasets available (200y, News On The Web, etc.).

### Globalization of the news

The world is becoming increasingly connected. Does the trend toward globalization also exist in the news? If so, since when? Detect and describe the ratio between international and local events through the years in a dataset of news.
